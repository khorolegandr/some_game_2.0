# some_game_2.0
It's a new version of my previous repository 'some_game'.
Reworked structure of project: added 'config.py' file, rebuilded communication between files.

After some tries, stop working on this project. I don't mind how it should be work. In some reason 'hero' object don't moves, while I press arrow buttons.
I did something wrong, but don't now, what. Maybe, I'll return to this game later.
